# Learning JavaScript, 3rd Edition
## Chapter 1: Your First Application

`index.html` includes the sample "hello world" application from Chapter 1 of the book.  The code represents the final state of the example (with the "hello world" message in a big black circle, and green circles drawn with every mouse click).  Examples for drawing a single circle, and drawing 64 evenly-spaced circles are included in commented-out sections; simply comment back in to see them in action.

Note that this is the only code in the book that intentionally uses ES5 syntax, to ensure that this example will run in any browser.
